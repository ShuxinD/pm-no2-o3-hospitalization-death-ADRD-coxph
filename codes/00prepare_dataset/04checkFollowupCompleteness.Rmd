title: "Check the completeness of follow-up in the ADRD population"
output: github_document
---

The dataset `ADRDcohort.fst` was directly generated from the denominator files, which follow the ADRD people till their death or the end of 2016.

## Setup and load data

```{r echo=FALSE}
rm(list = ls())
gc()

library(data.table)
setDTthreads(threads = 0)
library(dplyr)
library(NSAPHutils)
library(fst)

# setwd("/nfs/home/S/shd968/shared_space/ci3_shd968/dementia")
dir_ADRDcohort <-  "/nfs/home/S/shd968/shared_space/ci3_shd968/medicareADRD/data/"
dir_enrolledInfo <-  "/nfs/home/S/shd968/shared_space/ci3_shd968/medicareADRD/data/"

ADRDcohort <- read_fst(paste0(dir_ADRDcohort, "ADRDcohort.fst"), as.data.table = T)
enrolledInfo <- fread(paste0(dir_enrolledInfo, "EnrolledInfo.csv"))
```

Our final dataset should:

- be one row per person-year (long format)
- have follow-up info for every year starting from `firstADRDyr` till the end of study period (2016) or death or leaving the US, whichever comes first (though we do not need the info for `year==firstADRDyr` in survival analysis, we do need it for correcting index event bias)

## Basic info of original ADRD dataset

```{r echo=FALSE}
cat("number of subjects in original ADRD cohort dataset", uniqueN(ADRDcohort[,qid]), "\n")
cat("number of subjects in cohorts after removing NAs",uniqueN(na.omit(ADRDcohort)[,qid]),"\n")
```

Those who admitted for the first time with ADRD code and died in the same year don't contribute to the risk set. **Consider deleting those subjects**

```{r include=FALSE}
A <- ADRDcohort[, .(end_yr = max(year)), by = qid]
A <- merge(A, enrolledInfo, by.x = "qid", by.y = "QID")
no_contribution <- A[end_yr==firstADRDyr,]
# dim(no_contribution)
```

The number of person-years/subjects considered to be deleted due to no-contribution is `r dim(no_contribution)[1]`.

```{r}
temp <- na.omit(ADRDcohort[!(qid %in% no_contribution[,qid])]) # remove all the NAs and those without contribution to risk set
sum_temp <- temp[, .(start_yr = min(year),
                     end_yr = max(year),
                     count = uniqueN(year)), by = qid]
sum_temp <- merge(sum_temp, enrolledInfo, by.x = "qid", by.y = "QID", all.x = TRUE)
```

We constructed a temporary dataset named `temp` which is a subset of `ADRDcohort` after removing NA (not remove rows with `year==firstADRDyr`, but remove those making no contribution to the risk set), and summarize each person as one row in total `r dim(sum_temp)[1]` subjects:

- generated `start_yr` as the minimum of calendar year (should equal to `firstADRDyr`)
- `end_yr` as the maximum of calendar year
- `count` as the count number of unique calendar year for each subject. 

We also merged the enroll information (`firstADRDyear`) to `sum_temp`. `firstADRDyr` indicates the year that subjects should start to be followed-up.

`sum_temp` is a one-row-per-person dataset, looks like:

```{r echo=FALSE}
head(sum_temp)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
cat("the number of subjects in ADRD cohort (after removing NAs, and non-contribution subjects) is", dim(sum_temp)[1], "\n")
cat("the number of person-years in ADRD cohort (after removing NAs, and non-contribution subjects) is", dim(temp)[1], "\n")
cat("is there any duplication of the combination of `qid` and calendar year: ", any(duplicated(temp[,.(qid,year)])), "\n")
cat("is there any duplication of the combination of `qid` and age: ", any(duplicated(temp[,.(qid,age)])), "\n")
```

## Check the completeness of follow-up after removing no-contribution subjects

### 1. how many subjects were not followed-up from `firstADRDyr`

The indivudual-level info of those not followed-up from `firstADRDyr`:

```{r echo=FALSE}
sum_temp[start_yr != (firstADRDyr)]
```

Their info in denominator files:

```{r echo=FALSE}
temp[qid %in% sum_temp[start_yr != firstADRDyr, qid], ]
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
cat("the number of subjects not followed from firstADRDyr is", dim(sum_temp[start_yr != (firstADRDyr)])[1], "\n")
cat("the number of person-years of related subjects is", dim(temp[qid %in% sum_temp[start_yr != firstADRDyr, qid], ])[1], "\n")
```

<!-- sum_temp_added <- merge(sum_temp_added, enrolledInfo, by.x = "qid", by.y = "QID", all.x = TRUE) -->
<!-- ``` -->

### 2. how many people don't have each year's info

The indivudual-level info of those not having each year's info (containing those from 1.):

```{r echo=FALSE}
sum_temp[(end_yr-firstADRDyr+1) != count,]
setorder(temp,qid,year)
# summary(temp[qid%in%sum_temp[(end_yr-firstADRDyr+1) != count,qid],][,.SD[.N],by=qid][,dead])
```


```{r echo=FALSE}
cat("the number of subjects not having each year's info (contain those from 1.) is", dim(sum_temp[(end_yr-firstADRDyr+1) != count,])[1], "\n")
cat("the number of person-years (contain those from 1.) is", dim(temp[qid %in% sum_temp[(end_yr-firstADRDyr+1) != count,qid],])[1], "\n")
```

## Omit those without complete follow-up and contribution to the risk set

```{r echo=FALSE}
cat("the number of subjects without complete follow-up is", dim(sum_temp[(end_yr-firstADRDyr+1) != count,])[1], "\n")
cat("the number of person-years of related subjects is", dim(temp[qid %in% sum_temp[(end_yr-firstADRDyr+1) != count,qid],])[1], "\n")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
cat("the number of person-years/subjects making no-contribution to the risk set is", dim(no_contribution)[1], "\n")
```

```{r}
## save qid without complete follow-up or no contribution to risk set
omitInfo <- rbind(sum_temp[(end_yr-firstADRDyr+1) != count, .(qid,end_yr, firstADRDyr)], no_contribution)
```

The above subject (`r dim(omitInfo)[1]` subjects in total) do not have each year's info during follow-up or (mostly) make no contribution to the risk set. **Deleting them**

## Check right-censoring of the processed data

Check whether alive people were followed-up till the end of study period (2016) after excluding those without complete follow-up

```{r}
sum_temp[!(qid %in% temp[(dead),qid]), ][!(qid %in% omitInfo[,qid]),end_yr] %>% table()
```

We could see some alive subjects weren't followed-up till 2016. This should be considered as right-censored subjects in the analyses.
