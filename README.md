# airPollution_ADRD
air pollution and mortality/readmission in Medicare ADRD

## generate dataset
### extract all 2000-2016 hospitalization records with ADRD billing codes
[01extractADRDhospital.R](https://github.com/ShuxinD/airPollution_ADRD/blob/main/codes/00generate_data/01extractADRDhospital.R): 
- screened 25 billing codes from 2000 to 2016, though FFS data only billed 10 codes before a certain year (cannot remember) and change to 25 codes afterwards so as to select ADRD people as much as possible from Medicare data
- searched with both ICD-9 and ICD-10 ADRD codes - though ICD codes changed to the 10th version after 2015, in our dataset there are still some mix-ups of the 9th and 10th versions. ADRD diagnosis codes were based on [**Using Medicare claims in identifying Alzheimerâ€™s disease and related dementias**](https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.12199) and [**Identifying Medicare beneficiaries with dementia**](https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgs.17183); codes are modified from [a previous one](https://github.com/NSAPH/data_requests/blob/master/request_projects/jan2021_whanhee_fisrt_hosps/code/2_id_hospitalizations.R).
- `primary` fst file contains hospitalization records with first diagnosis code (`DIAG1`) as ADRD, and `secondary` fst file contains those with any of codes (1-25) as ADRD. (`secondary` file contains `primary`); export several `.fst` files named as `ADRD'type'_'year'.fst`, e.g. `ADRDprimary_2000.fst`

### generate ADRD cohort enrollment info and readmission info based on hospilization record
[02getEnrolledInfo.R](https://github.com/ShuxinD/airPollution_ADRD/blob/main/codes/00generate_data/02getEnrolledInfo.R) 
- the qid changed after a certain time, but there is a crosswalk file linking qids. According to Ben, QIDs in raw dataset have been converted to one single formmat
- still, some qids weren't matched. We excluded those problemetic qids based on the .csv file Ben provided.
- export `EnrolledInfo.csv`, only containing `QID` and `firstADRDyr`(first hospitalization admission year with ADRD). one-row-per-person
- export `ReAdInfo.csv`, only containing `QID` and `ReAdyr`(second hospitalization admission year with ADRD). one-row-per-person

### extract denominator info for ADRD people in Medicare
[03extractDenominatorFile.R](https://github.com/ShuxinD/airPollution_ADRD/blob/main/codes/00generate_data/03extractDenominatorFile.R) 
- donominator files were prepared by research group before, should contain all Medicare enrollee's demographic info
- subset the denominator files to those with `QID` which appeared in `EnrolledInfo.csv`
- subset the person-year row data to those starting from `firstADRDyr ` (`year>=firstADRDyr`) based on `EnrolledInfo.csv`, for each subject
- remove duplicates, export `ADRDpeople_denom.fst`

### merge air pollution by ZIP code and calendar year
[04mergeExposure.R](https://github.com/ShuxinD/airPollution_ADRD/blob/main/codes/00generate_data/04mergeExposure.R) 
- PM2.5, NO2, ozone, summer ozone
- merge by the previous year of follow-up year
- export `ADRDcohort.fst`

### check the completeness of follow-up
[05checkFollowupCompleteness.md](https://github.com/ShuxinD/airPollution_ADRD/blob/main/codes/00generate_data/05checkFollowupCompleteness.md)
- should start from the next year of first hospitalization with ADRD, ends at event/loss/end of study period
- we considered to fill in all the missing person years, but without denominator information it will be very hard. After checking the death risk, we decided to omit those without complete follow-up
- exported `omitInfo.csv` with all qids that will be dropped

### clean data
[06cleanData.R](https://github.com/ShuxinD/airPollution_ADRD/blob/main/code/00generate_data/06cleanData.R)
- clean `ADRDcohort.fst`: remove NAs; remove those without complete follow-up
- add necessary variables into the dataset: `entry_age_break`, `race_collapsed`, `ox`, `region`
- export `ADRDcohort_clean.fst`
